# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

## Thinking

* 2 pointer, first pointer go n steps, then two pointer go together util this first hit the end of list.
* the second pointer will be the node before the removing node.

## Steps:

1. set dummy node and set  2 pointers.
2. this first step **n steps.**
3. the second step until the first reach the end of the list.
4. this second will be **n + 1** distance \( the node before the removing node \) before the end.

```javascript
var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
   let dummy = new ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    let first = dummy
    let second = dummy
    
    // the node before the nth node from end just need to step nth steps from the dummy.  

    for(let i = 0 ; i < n ; i ++){
        first = first.next
    }
    while(first.next) {
        first = first.next
        second = second.next
    }
    
    second.next = second.next.next
    return dummy.next
}
```
