# 141. Linked List Cycle

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

#### example 1: 

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 
Output: true Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list,
 where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

#### example 2 :

```text
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, 
where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

## Thinking

define tow pointer, with fast and slow . if fast catches slow , it must be a cycled list.

## Steps:

1.  define slow and fast pointer.
2.  fast takes 2 steps and slow takes 1 steps every time.
3.  consider fast will reach the end fist \(in no cycled list \). 
4. Therefore , when fast && fast.next exist, go ahead. 

```text
var hasCycled = (head)=>{
    let slow = head
    let fast = head
    while(fast && fast.next) {
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
        if(fast === slow) return true
    }
    return false
}
```
