# 15. 3Sum

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

#### Thinking:

1 . sort array and , use tree pointers.

2.  fix one pointer , move other two pointers.

3. after find the other , move the fixed pointer.



{% hint style="info" %}
**edge case: head = \[ \],  head = \[ 1 \]** 

**if pointer's next has same value , we need to skip and go next. drop the duplicate answer.**

**the used pointer will not be use again.**

**i is check after i++, so need to compare its previous one , i-1**

**to avoid indexOutOfBound exception , j &lt; k need always true . because , we need to j++ , k-- in the range we just limit.**
{% endhint %}
