# 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

**Notice** that you **should not modify** the linked list.

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list,
 where tail connects to the second node.
```

## Think

**Foryd circle detection** a great method to solve this kind of problem with slow and fast pointer.

## Steps:

1. **Foryd algorithm tells us : from the meet point , and head.**
2. take one step every time for both.
3.  the next meet point will be the initial node of cycle.

```javascript
var detectCycle =(head)=>{
    let slow = head
    let fast = head
    let isCycled = false
    let meet = null

    while(fast && fast.next){
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if(slow === fast) {
            meet = slow
            isCycled = true
            break
        }
    }

    if(isCycled){
        slow = head
        while(slow !== meet) {
            slow = slow.next
            meet = meet.next
        }
        return meet
    }
    return null
}
