# 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

**How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:**

We use the multilevel linked list from **Example 1** above:

```text
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
```

#### Thinking:

try to use recursion to connect child to parent, 

#### Steps:

1. build a dummy to avoid case =&gt; head = null 
2. call self if cur has child , else cur = cur.next \(as normal\)
3. flatten return child's head , however , we iterate it to last node.
4. tail point to cur.next
5. if cur.next exist , prev point to tail
6. child point to cur 
7. cur point to child
8. cur.child disconnect 
9. is cur.child is not exist , cur move to next
10. return dummy.next to avoid head = null error.

```javascript
var flatten = function(head) {
    let dummy = new Node(0)
    dummy.next = head
    let cur = head
    while(cur) {
        if(cur.child){
          let child = cur.child
          let next = cur.next
          let tail = flatten(cur.child)
          while(tail.next) tail = tail.next // tail is moved to the last node of child list
          tail.next = next 
          if(cur.next) next .prev = tail
          cur.next = child 
          child.prev = cur
          cur.child = null
        
        }else {
            cur = cur.next
        }
    } 
    return dummy.next
};
```
